        	<h4> Website for the Student's Association of Faculdade de Psicologia - UL</h4>
    		<h5> <b>Platform:</b> Outsystems  |   <b>Category:</b> Work</h5>
  			<p>This project began when a friend of mine came to me asking if I was available to make a website for his student's association. I wasn't sure about it, however I accepted talking to the president of said association to see what they wanted exactly so I could estimate the time I would have to put into it. Seeing that it would be rather simple, I accepted their proposal and being a project for a friend, I agreed terms on a later full payment upon delivery of the website.</p>
  			<p> As I took a course of UI/UX as part of my Master's Degree at FCT-UNL where we developed a mockup of an app in Outsystems (platform of our choice), I decided to develop the website in that platform as well. The project went well, I kept constant communication with the president to make sure the development went according to their expectations and continuously made little changes matching his feedback. The website was rather simple, with an image carousel of their activities in the top, then a message board and event list at the bottom and tabs for their departments and groups. It also featured an administration page that was accessible through a login, which allowed the association to add/change info in the page.</p>
  			<p>The website took some time to be finished, especially because I was doing it only in my spare time as agreed with the association however, in the end, they said that the website was no longer needed and I dropped the project. They explained to me the reasoning behind it, and even though I think I deserved some kind of compensation, I decided it wasn't worth the hassle and didn't bother arguing about it.</p>

  			<h4> FlameHound - Website/app for submitting/viewing occurrencies or hazards</h4>
    		<h5> <b>Platform:</b> Google app Engine / Rest/ Jersey  |   <b>Category:</b> University Project</h5>
  			<p>As part of my academic program, I was integrated in a group of 4 other people from my course in order to enroll in a semester-long project, developing a complete platform that could eventually be used in the current context of the country. The idea was to develop an website, a mobile app and a server that would allow for users to submit a form with hazard situations, allowing for other users to visualize them in their device, rate them and comment. There would be other type of users who would belong to associations or departments which would be responsible with dealing with the submitted ocurrences, meaning that this platform would act as a middle-man between the citizents and the authorities.</p>
  			<p>Since front-end isn't really my thing, I opted right away for the back-end, so I volunteered to develop the server and ended up doing it on my own because nobody else wanted to do back-end. I developed the server using Java using Maven to import the Rest and Jersey libraries to support AJAX requests from both the website and app, working with JSON in the requests for easier parsing of data on both sides. For storage I used the readily available Google Datastore for all the user and occurrence-related info, and made an integration with Dropbox for storing the images. Looking behind, it would be better to store the images in another way, but since I had already worked with Dropbox and OAUTH on another project, it seemed like a reliable solution at the time.</p>
  			<p>In the end we had an exhibit of the solutions where department representatives would go from booth to booth to see the solutions and ours received good feedback on the responsiveness and looks of the app and website.</p>

        	<h4> Sudoku Solving genetic algorithm </h4>
    		<h5> <b>Platform:</b> Java  |   <b>Category:</b> Personal project</h5>
  			<p>After having my first A.I course in university, I decided to dwelve deeper into some areas that I studied in it and began this project out of the blue in a summer afternoon. I had already seen a colleague of mine making a sudoku solver using a Clingo, however I thought that it would be boring programming constraints and using pure logic to solve a sudoku, so I began thinking about other more exciting ways to get to a solution, even if it was in a slower, less optimized way, after all, this was a project that I did just for fun.</p>
  			<p>I decided I would make an algorithm where a filled puzzle would be an individual, each 1x1 square would be a gene, composing a genetic sequence of 81 bits (1 if the square was a valid solution for that puzzle and context and 0 if it wasn't), and used a selection function where it would consider an individual with the most correct squares as the the most "fit" for reproduction. The genes would then be mixed randomly between two individuals with similar fitness scores, keeping intact correct squares and mixing up the incorrect ones. It also had a small mutation chance, allowing it to break out of deadlocks by sometimes changing random "correct" genes.</p>
  			<p> It was a lot of fun to program it, and even though it wasn't an optimized solution, it would sometimes (randomly) come up with a solution in the easier puzzles I gave it after some generations. Sometimes I would leave it running and it would reach generations in the millions, sometimes getting close to the solution, but never reaching it. Maybe some changes to the fitness function or to the gene transmission method could be made and improve the results, but it was just a summer project that was put aside after a few weeks.</p>

        <div id="p4" class="w3-container w3-hide">
        	<h4> Anti-Cheat software for the official PC Fifa Pro Clubs Portuguese League</h4>
    		<h5> <b>Platform:</b> Java/Dropbox  |  <b>Category:</b> Personal project</h5>
  			<p>On my second season as a Professional FIFA player for Leões Esports, the game (FIFA 18)had an exploit where a player could use a third-party software and change his avatar's attributes, making it more powerful than what the game allowed. Even though there were many suspicions on some players using that software during official games (which was completely illegal according to the association's rules), it was impossible to prove it since you can't check other player's attributes during the game.</p>
  			<p> With this problem becoming more and more blatant, I decided to spend some afternoons trying to find a solution to the problem. My idea was to try to give the admins information about all the programs executing in the player's pc, allowing them to investigate logs that would be created during the game in case of suspicious activity in-game. So that's what I did, the program was rather simple, especially to avoid intense internet or processor usage to not influence the player's performance during the games. What the program did was record all the open processes upon execution (before entering the game) and store them in a file as plain text, in another one encrypted using AES and in another file as a recursive hash of all lines (to serve as log-integrity proof), then the program would constantly concatenate new logs every 5 minutes or everytime a new process was identified. The files would be distributed as follows: The encrypted log would be stored in the player's pc and was supposed to be uploaded by the player to a folder in the dropbox along with the hash file, meanwhile the plaintext log (with the encryption key of the encrypted file at the top) and the hash file would be uploaded automatically to another dropbox folder by the program using REST and OAUTH2 token as authentication. While the first dropbox folder would be respective and accessible by each player (and the admins could access it as well), the second one was only visible to admins and would serve as confirmation (in case of file tampering). The program would also allow for the decryption of the logs if the admin version was used.</p>
  			<p> The Anti-Cheat software was tested in some games between my club and some others that were fond of the project, however when its usage in official games was voted by all clubs, it was denied and the cheater problem continued.</p>

  			<h4>My first job</h4>
  			<p>When I was 19 I decided that my laptop desperatly needed an upgrade, its NVIDIA 850M needed retirement from gaming. After picking the pieces and browsing websites I came to the conclusion that my savings just weren't enough, so I decided to work gathering fruit for a whole week. We were four friends in a poorly equipped house at Cadaval (it didn't even have matresses!), so we ended up sleeping on hardwood floor in sleeping bags and waking up at 5:30 a.m. It was a tough week, but extremely rewarding by seeing my hard work transform into a decent paycheck, in fact, it was so rewarding that I repeated the experiment the following year!</p>
  			<p>We worked 8 hours from 7 a.m until 4 p.m and the sun was definitively the worst part of the job. Being outside in the hours of the most heat doing physical labor is not easy, and made building the pc even more enjoyable, since it is there on my desk because of my hard work.</p>

  			<h4>Sports</h4>
  			<p>Whilst studying in middle school, I developed a big passion about football, both playing and watching it live in a stadium or on tv. To be honest, I ain't the best at it, but I can play fairly well and even pull off some tricks in a more friendly environment. While I was a kid, I played football at Odivelas Futebol Clube and then Futsal as a defender. I even played in an amateur league called "Liga All Stars" in a team formed by me and my friends, however the other teams were simply better than us so we decided to stick to 5v5 or 7v7 games between us.</p>
  			<p>Along the years I've been trying some different sports. I began playing rugby for my university team, but it wasn't really my thing. Then transitioned into tennis, where I found my second favourite sport and since it's easier to gather 1 or 3 people to play tennis than 13 to play football, whenever I'm able I try to schedule a 1v1 or a 2v2 game with friends. I'm still a rookie, but I believe that with practice I can definitively improve.</p>

        <div id="fifa" class="w3-container w3-hide w3-white">
  			<h4>Professional FIFA</h4>
  			<p>Since 2012 I've owned every edition of the game FIFA, sometimes even buying it the day it came out. In the game there is a gamemode called Pro Clubs where somebody can create a club and play with up to 10 other players, each occupying one position. What began as hours in the night with my friends on Skype playing this mode, some years later transitioned into something more serious when I signed up for a professional team called "Leões FC" (at the time). The team followed strict schedules for training (yes, training sessions in FIFA), enforced by our manager, ex-footballer and Portuguese International Ricardo Sousa. Initially it scared me being in such a competitive environment, not only in the official games for the Pro Clubs Portuguese League, but also within the team, since we were around 18 players in the team, only 11 could play at a time, and we had to prove our worth to be selected for the official matches. <p>
  			Fast forward 1 year, and the league (which was amateur when I entered) is being regulated and managed by the Portuguese Federation of Football and, as you can imagine, the pressure to win everything increased drastically, since it could mean more exposure to the team in a time where professional football teams were beggining to invest in e-sports. In the end of the second season, the team was rebranded as "Leões Esports" just in time of making team t-shirts to wear in the prize-awarding ceremony at Cidade do Futebol for winning the League for the second time in a row.</p>
  			<p>My FIFA career ended after my third season in the team, after the third consecutive championship title and the first FIFA Pro Clubs Champions League run for the team. Despite the passion I had for the game and the team, I needed to take time off in order to focus properly on my studies since I no longer had the time to spend 18 hours weekly on training. If there is a set of skills I can take away from this experience, it would be not only the ability to deal with stressful and sometimes adverse environments due to my experience playing the official games, but also the capability to set routines and make efforts in order to stand out and improve my skills and abilities.
